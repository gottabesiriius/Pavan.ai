It should utilise existing python-based ML libraries. Developed model need to be validated with unseen independent data. Challenge: To utilise large satellite data having gaps under cloudy conditions To select suitable ML algorithm and ensure optimal fitting of ML model for desired accuracy To validate model output with unseen independent data Usage: To enhance air quality knowledge, Sharpen focus at local level Users: Researchers and government bodies monitoring/working on air quality assessment Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Individual components are available, comprehensive and proven solution does not exist. Desired Outcome: Fine resolution air quality map of NO2 .. this project is given by ISRO ministry for Smart Indua Hackathon 2024 - Problem Statement - 1734 ....  now user asked this question : {question} , if this is anyway related to our application or project or machine learning or general AIr quality and environment knowledge - answer it in a neat way .. else just respond that the question is irrelevnat ', stream=False)
